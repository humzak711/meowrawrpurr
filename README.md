# crappy bluepill that crashes n shi

this is ass ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

this is a work in progress shitty type 2 hv i wrote because i was a bit bored,
its very unfinished, i gotta implement proper cleanup routines, and setup
handlers for everything, due to having not implemented every handler yet, 
on bare metal this will crash, but i did get it to run in vmware a few times 
without crashing

//todo:
- not emulate shit like a silly billy & get system to run smooth/not crash
- proper cleanup routines + proper safety/feature checks + rewrite my code to not be shit
